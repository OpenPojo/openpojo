PojoValidator is used to run all Pojo validations.

=== Introduction ===

PojoValidator is a class that is used to hold all the "boundaries" you want to test for, and execute those checks.

=== Details ===

Working with this class is very simple, first create an instance of the class, and then configure the instance with the [Rule](s) and/or [Tester](s) you want to run your Pojo's through.

see [http://code.google.com/p/openpojo/source/browse/trunk/example/com/openpojo/PojoTest.java PojoTest] for a sample on how to configure PojoValidator.
