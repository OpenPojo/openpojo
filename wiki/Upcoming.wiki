Ramblings about what I think I want to add next...

== Up Coming features in no particular order ==
  * Find a way to speed up the BusinessIdentity to reuse as much as possible of the introspection work done once.
  * Auto-register super types from concrete types return from RandomGenerator.
  * Better handling for JDK 1.6 collection's generation vs. 1.5.
  * Add the ability to filter PojoClass based on source path. 

*Note:* If there is something you'd like to see that isn't listed please drop me a line or open a ticket in the Issues section.
