Ramblings about what I think I want to add next...

== Up Coming features ==
 * *In no particular order*
  # *DONE* Add toString method to any class to call which would return string representation for all fields.
   # Will add documentation on usage soon.
 # *In Progress* Improve the JavaDocs and make them more complete.
  # Add support for constructing objects using parameter list (revamp PojoClass.newInstance()).

*Note:* If there is something you'd like to see that isn't listed please drop me a line or open a ticket in the Issues section.
