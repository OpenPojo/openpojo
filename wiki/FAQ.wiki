== Setup ==
 # How do I get started?
  * See [http://code.google.com/p/openpojo/wiki/Tutorial Tutorial]
 # How do I configure my eclipse project against the source code of OpenPojo?
  * Checkout the code:
   * svn checkout http://openpojo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openpojo-read-only
  * Download and Install maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
  * Download and install eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
  * Open a command prompt and go to the folder where you check'ed out the code.
   * run mvn eclipse:eclipse
  * Start eclipse and import the project.

== Usage ==
 # In my company we use field prefixes so in a class we can have String m_name with getName setName, how do I use OpenPojo to validate getters/setters?
  * In your test setup method, and before you enumerate any POJOs call AttributeHelper.registerFieldPrefix(String).
 # We use hungarian notation, what can we do?
  * You can call AttributeHelper.registerFieldPrefix(String) as many times as you want, they are all stored and used.
 # How do I filter out all enums as well as package-info?
  * create a FilterChain and pass in the constructor all the filters that you want to run against your POJOs.
  * Pass that FilterChain to the PojoClassFactory when you're enumerating - getPojoClasses(packageName, PojoClassFilter).

== Performance ==
 * How fast is OpenPojo?
  * The short answer is "VERY" fast, the latest numbers were tested on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo machine and the test was conducted on 1000 POJOs tested with all rule and testers in ~2.2 secs that is over 430 POJOs per second.
