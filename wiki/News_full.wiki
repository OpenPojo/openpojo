#Latest news on what is happening in OpenPojo.

= News =
 * *2010-06-22:*
  * Fixed a problem with the wiring of the assertion framework not detecting that TestNG not available and throwing initialization errors.
 * *2010-06-21:*
  * Added a BusinessIdentityTester to validate that equals and hashcode calls for a POJO are actually being dispatched to BusinessIdentity facade.
  * Added BusinessKeyMustExistRule to validate that at least one @BusinessKey has been defined and is set to required.
  * Also IdentityFactory now can be configured to route calls to custom IdentityHandler using register/unregister allowing interception of equality/hashcode/validate calls for greater flexibility (specially when writing custom Testers).
 * *2010-06-01:*
  * @BusinessKey annotation is now inherited by child classes for equality & hash code generation.
 * *2010-05-26:*
  * Added support for dynamically creating random instance for any Interface reference.
  * Added support for dynamically creating random enum for any custom enum.
  * Added a facade for Asserts with auto-select based on user env (auto detect and select routing for Asserts, TestNG then JUnit).
  * Added a facade for logging with auto-select based on user env (auto detect and select routing for logs, SLF4J, Log4J then Java Logger)
 * *2010-05-20:*
  * All code is now being tested using unit tests. 100% code coverage.
 * *2010-05-12:*
  * Added PojoClass.getMethods call that returns a list of all PojoMethods adding more control on methods introspection and invocation.
 * *2010-04-22:*
  * Added java.math.BigDecimal to BasicRandomGenerator (Thanks to Arun S.).
  * Added java.math.BigInteger to BasicRandomGenerator.
 * *2010-04-16:*
  * Test coverage is > 80%.
  * Added java.util.Date to BasicRandomGenerator (Thanks to Arun S.).
  * PojoClassImpl.newInstance(Object[]) now works matching argument count.
 * *2010-04-12:* Added source jar to the downloadable zip file.
 * *2010-03-29:* Added Javadoc to the package zip file.
 * *2010-03-22:* Added *toString* implementation that allows you to just delegate using BusinessIdentity.toString(this) calls, will String-inize all contents of your Class.
 * *2010-03-11:* Now fully tested and certified the code is pretty stable main features include
  # *HashCode* & *Equals* can now be done using the *BusinessKey* annotation, just include the openpojo.jar in your runtime environment.
  # Testing done using Rules, and Testers easily.
