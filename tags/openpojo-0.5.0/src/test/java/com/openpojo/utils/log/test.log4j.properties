# This configuration file is used to test our integration point with
# Log4J, don't change it as you may break the unit testing.
#
# Considerations when changing:
# 	1. The com.openpojo logger level must be set to TRACE
#	2. All logs from com.openpojo must go to utils.log.MockAppenderLog4J appender.
#	3. No layout changes done on any messages sent to Mock appender.
#

# Don't touch those.

# Uncomment the following if you want to see output on your console.
